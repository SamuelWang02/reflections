How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was quick to have a way to compare two file's differences and have the two versions side by side

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You could look at where you made your mistakes and quickly find the bugs.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

The pros of having to manually choose when to save is that if you can experiment, but if you make a mistake you can just not save it. The cons of it is that you could lose valuble data be
because you might accidentally close the window without saving.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It is probably because in Git, you can have mutiple files open, while in Google docs you can only have one file open at the same time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You can find the ids of different commits with git log and git diff them to find changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You could just go back to before you broke the thing

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Checking files when I experiment

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You can compare for better code.
